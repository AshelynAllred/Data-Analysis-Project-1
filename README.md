# Los Angeles Crime Trends: A Focus on Identity Theft

In this project we analyzed crime trends from 2020-2022 with a focus on Identity Theft. 

Our analysis contains:

* A high level breakdown of the reported crimes from 2020-2022 (by year and month).

* Year over Year crime trends of the most and least reported crimes of 2020-2022.

* A deeper look at Identity Theft Theft crime trends and why we chose to look specifically at Identity Theft.

# Limitations of our Analysis:

*Only looking at reported crimes (not looking at outcome of crimes)

*Only looking at data for the city of Los Angeles, CA
-Trends may differ across cities, states, and countries

*Our analysis on Identity Theft only takes into account records that have Identity Theft listed as the main crime.
-There were multiple crime codes possible for a given incident
-Crimes were listed in descending order of severity, so we are only looking at the ‘main’ crime


The main notebook can be found above titled: main.ipynb

The "Resources" file contains:
* Sliced CSV files taken from the original dataset due to the file being too latge for GitHug's file size limit
* Saved config files from the main.ipynb
* Documenation the provides additional information on how to breakdown codes from the original dataset.
