# Los Angeles Crime Trends: A Focus on Identity Theft

In this project we analyzed crime trends from 2020-2022 with a focus on Identity Theft. 

Our analysis contains:

* A high level breakdown of the reported crimes from 2020-2022 (by year and month).

* Year over Year crime trends of the most and least reported crimes of 2020-2022.

* A deeper look at Identity Theft theft crime trends and why we chose to look specifically at Identity Theft theft.

The main notebook can be found above titled: main.ipynb

The raw dataset that was used in our analysis can be found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

Due to the raw dataset being too large for GitHub's file size limit, the data was sliced into separate .CSV files by Year. This can be found in the "Resources" folder above.
